# 🧮 Scientific Calculator Application  

## 📌 About the Project  
The **Scientific Calculator Application** is a web-based tool designed to perform a wide range of mathematical calculations efficiently. It provides users with a simple yet powerful interface to solve basic and advanced mathematical operations.  

This project was developed as part of my **Full-Stack Development Internship at IIDT Blackbuck Engineers / APSCHE**. The calculator is built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, with optimized logic for enhanced accuracy and user experience.
